# As each Puppet agent runs for the first time, it submits a certificate signing request (CSR) to the certificate authority (CA) Puppet master.
# You must log into that server to check for and sign certificates. On the Puppet master:
#  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list to see any outstanding requests.
#  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign <NAME> to sign a request.
# After an agentâ€™s certificate is signed, it regularly fetches and applies configuration catalogs from the Puppet master.
